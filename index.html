<h1>Privacy Policy – E-Wallet</h1>
<p class="note">Effective Date: June 8, 2022 • Last Updated: Sept 18, 2025</p>

<p>
  Shine App (“we,” “our,” or “us”) built the <strong>E-Wallet</strong> application as a free financial management
  service.
  This Privacy Policy describes in detail how we collect, use, disclose, store, and protect your personal and
  non-personal information.
  It also explains the rights you have regarding your data, and how you may exercise those rights.
  By installing, accessing, or using E-Wallet, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>1. Scope and Applicability</h2>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the E-Wallet mobile application, website, and related services.
  It covers information collected through:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The mobile app installed from Google Play</li>
  <li>User accounts created via Google OAuth</li>
  <li>Analytics, crash reporting, and advertising technologies integrated into the app (including Google AdMob and
    Google Play Services)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This policy does not apply to third-party websites or services that are linked within the app but not operated by us.
  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those third parties.
</p>

<h2>2. Definitions</h2>
<p>For clarity, the following terms are used throughout this Privacy Policy:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Data that can be used to identify you as an individual, such as your email
    address, display name, or device identifiers.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> Data that does not directly identify you, such as anonymized usage
    statistics or aggregated analytics.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cookies & Similar Technologies:</strong> Small files or tools used by third-party services (e.g., AdMob)
    to deliver ads, measure effectiveness, and improve performance.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third-party companies engaged to provide services such as advertising,
    analytics, or crash reporting.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Depending on how you use E-Wallet, we may collect the following categories of information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you sign in with Google OAuth, we collect your email address and display
    name. This is used solely for authentication, account management, and personalization within the app.
  </li>
  <li><strong>App Data:</strong> Financial entries such as income, expenses, categories, and budgets. By default, this
    data is stored locally on your device. If cloud synchronization is enabled, it may be transmitted securely to our
    servers.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Usage & Log Data:</strong> When errors occur or for performance analysis, we may collect technical data
    including device type, IP address, operating system, app configuration, time/date stamps, and crash reports.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> Through Google AdMob, we may collect non-identifiable data such as device
    identifiers, ad impressions, interactions, and preferences to deliver relevant ads.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cookies & Tracking:</strong> Third-party SDKs may use cookies or similar tools for ad personalization,
    frequency capping, and analytics.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>We use collected information for legitimate purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To authenticate users and provide secure sign-in with Google OAuth</li>
  <li>To store and display your financial entries within the app</li>
  <li>To deliver ads through Google AdMob so we can keep the app free</li>
  <li>To analyze crashes, fix bugs, and improve stability</li>
  <li>To monitor usage trends and enhance user experience</li>
  <li>To maintain security, prevent fraud, and enforce app policies</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.
</p>

<h2>5. Sharing Information with Third Parties</h2>
<p>
  We share limited information with third parties only as necessary to provide core services.
  Specifically:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Receives anonymized device and ad interaction data to serve personalized and
    contextual ads. You may opt out of personalized ads via your Google account settings.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Google Play Services & Firebase:</strong> Receives diagnostic and crash information to help us analyze and
    fix app issues.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Analytics Providers:</strong> May collect aggregated usage statistics to help us improve app performance.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These third parties are contractually obligated not to use your data for unrelated purposes.
  We do not grant them permission to access or process your personal information beyond what is required.
</p>

<h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>
  While E-Wallet itself does not use cookies, third-party libraries (such as AdMob) may use cookies, SDKs, or other
  tracking tools to deliver ads and measure performance.
  You can choose to block or delete cookies via your device settings. However, doing so may affect the functionality of
  some features.
</p>

<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
  We retain different categories of information for varying periods:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account Data (email, display name):</strong> Retained until you request deletion of your account.</li>
  <li><strong>App Data (financial entries):</strong> Stored locally until you uninstall the app, or on our servers if
    you enable cloud sync, and deleted upon request.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Log & Diagnostic Data:</strong> Retained temporarily for troubleshooting, usually no longer than 90 days,
    unless required for legal or security purposes.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> Managed by Google AdMob according to their policies. See <a
    href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank">AdMob Privacy</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Data Security</h2>
<p>
  We implement commercially reasonable safeguards such as encryption, access controls, and secure transmission protocols
  to protect your information.
  However, no method of storage or transmission is entirely secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot
  guarantee absolute security.
</p>
<p>
  In the event of a security incident that affects your data, we will notify affected users in accordance with
  applicable laws.
</p>

<h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
  If you access the app outside of the country where our servers are located, your information may be transferred and
  processed across borders.
  By using E-Wallet, you consent to the transfer of information to countries with different data protection laws, as
  permitted by applicable regulations.

  E-Wallet is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.
  If we become aware that a child has provided personal information, we will delete it promptly.

</ul>

<h2>13. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
