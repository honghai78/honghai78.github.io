      Shine E-Wallet provides two methods for you to request deletion of your account and related data:
    </p>
    
    <h3>1. Request directly in the App</h3>

      <li>Navigate to <strong>Configuration Tab</strong></li>
      <li>Select <strong>Data Management</strong></li>
      <li>Choose <strong>Delete Cloud Data</strong></li>
      <li>Confirm by selecting <strong>OK, Continue</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After confirmation, your account and related data will be permanently removed and cannot be restored.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2. Request via Email</h3>
    <p>
      You can send an email request to 
      <a href="mailto:shineappservice@gmail.com">shineappservice@gmail.com</a>.  
      Please include the email address you used to log in with Google OAuth.
